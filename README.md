#### Scripts and addons for DT Garry's Mod servers ####

This is a collection of Lua scripts and addons that are used or have been used in The Drunken T's Garry's Mod servers. Code that is specific to the Trouble in Terrorist Town gamemode will be separate.

Disclaimer: some of this code is _old_ and _ugly_. I know it's clich√© for developers to claim that their code is messy. Some of this code was created several years ago when I had little or no programming experience, much less than I do today. If I had the time and motivation, I'd probably rewrite a lot of it. The Drunken T Community has been around for five years now and we've accumulated a lot of stuff over the years. However, the code that will be posted here will have been used at some point on a DT server, most of it coming from our Trouble in Terrorist Town servers. Everything here worked at some point in time and should continue to work, though updates to Garry's Mod have the potential to break things.

* Scripts and addons made for DT servers will be included here.
* Major modifications to default Lua files in the game may be included here.
